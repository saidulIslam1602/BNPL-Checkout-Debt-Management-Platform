## üö¶ Usage Examples

### Tokenize Payment Method
```csharp
var request = new TokenizePaymentMethodRequest
{
    CustomerId = customerId,
    PaymentMethod = PaymentMethod.CreditCard,
    PaymentData = new Dictionary<string, object>
    {
        ["card_number"] = "4111111111111111",
        ["expiry"] = "12/25",
        ["cvv"] = "123",
        ["last4"] = "1111",
        ["brand"] = "Visa"
    },
    IsDefault = true
};

var result = await tokenizationService.TokenizePaymentMethodAsync(request);
```

### Assess Payment Risk
```csharp
var assessment = await fraudDetectionService.AssessPaymentRiskAsync(
    paymentRequest, 
    ipAddress
);

if (assessment.RequiresManualReview)
{
    // Flag for manual review
}
```

### Process Settlement Batch
```csharp
var batchRequest = new CreateSettlementBatchRequest
{
    MerchantId = merchantId,
    FromDate = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-7),
    ToDate = DateTime.UtcNow
};

var batch = await settlementService.CreateSettlementBatchAsync(batchRequest);
await settlementService.ProcessSettlementBatchAsync(batch.Data.Id);
```

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### Database Migration
The enhanced models require database migration to add new tables and columns. Run the following command:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add PaymentApiEnhancements
dotnet ef database update
```
